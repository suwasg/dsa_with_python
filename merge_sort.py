What is Merge Sort?
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively:

Divides the array into two halves.
Sorts each half.
Merges the two sorted halves back together.

âœ… Best Used For:
Sorting large datasets efficiently.
External sorting (Sorting large files stored in disk/memory).
Sorting linked lists (due to efficient merging).

PSEUDOCODE:
MERGE_SORT(A, left, right)
1. If left < right:
2.     mid = (left + right) / 2
3.     MERGE_SORT(A, left, mid)
4.     MERGE_SORT(A, mid+1, right)
5.     MERGE(A, left, mid, right)
